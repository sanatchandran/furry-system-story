There was once a young man from Madison who moved to Barcelona to live by himself.

Then he adopted a dog from Dane Humane Society because he was lonely;(â‰ˆ

When he got home he realized that he had no food for the dog he just adopted so he
went to WalMart to buy him some food. He entered the store and walked to the dog food.
When he looked at the price of the dog food he realized that he did not have enough
money to buy his newly adopted dog food.
So he decided to pick up six more jobs in order to afford the dog.
