There was once a young man from Madison who moved to Barcelona to live by himself.

Then he adopted a dog from Dane Humane Society because he was lonely;(â‰ˆ

When he got home he realized that he had no food for the dog he just adopted so he
went to WalMart to buy him some food. He entered the store and walked to the dog food.
When he looked at the price of the dog food he realized that he did not have enough
money to buy his newly adopted dog food.
So he decided to pick up six more jobs in order to afford the dog. 

As the man spent less and less time at home and more time at work, he began to notice
that his dog would seem preoccupied during their short times spent together. After a
particularly long day at work, he unlocked his front door and slumped inside only to
be greeted with a surprise party. His dog had picked up a part time job behind his back
in order to earn enough money to pay a bunch of people to pretend to be his masters
friends for a party.
